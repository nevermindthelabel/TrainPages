# Train-Scheduler

**Overview**

See app displayed live on Github Pages [here](https://nevermindthelabel.github.io/Train-Scheduler/)

In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

Using - HTML, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to manipulate the DOM and [momentjs](http://momentjs.com/) for the time logic. The data collected from user input is stored in a [Firebase database](https://firebase.google.com/) and then pulled down to populate the table.
